# Gornath
A companion site for my Dungeons & Dragons campaign. 

## Overview
In one month, an army of demons will attack the city of Gornath. As part of the ruling council, the players must help the city prepare for the invasion. Each day cards are drawn with events that must be resolved. The result influences the key stats of the city: Loyalty to the chief (and the council), the Warriors that protect the city, Order and stability within the city, and Reverence the people of Gornath have for the old gods of the land.

Resources can also be earned which allow projects to be researched and developed, and intel can be acquired to spend on uncovering secret information about the invading force that will help in the final battle.

Finally, there's a quest log to help the players keep track of unresolved storylines and political factions.
